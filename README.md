# Data Science Portfolio

This repository contains a collection of projects made for personal interest, learning new tools, grapling with new/known concepts and showcasing some of my work. My intention consist in getting better at working with data and deepen my knowledge of data science concepts, models and tech stack.

Feel free to reach out if you are interested in what I've been doing here or to make some suggestions on how to improve.
